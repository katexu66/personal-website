        <p>I love creating things,
            whether physically (building, assembling)
            or artistically (music,

                content creation</a>). I'm passionate about all things nature and biomimicry-
            especially when it's intersected with robotics and engineering!

        <p> in high school, I grew 50 basil plants in my kitchen to study how mycorrhizal plants could be used to purify lead-contaminated water,
            attended the International Kawasaki Disease Symposium in Montreal and hugged the daughter of Dr. Kawasaki (who discovered the heart disease
            I was diagnosed with at 3 y/o!), and founded the first competitive badminton team in my school's history.

    <!--I've been playing piano since I was 4 years old,
    and have found immense joy and creative expression in music.
    Over the years, I've picked up a few more instruments, including
    the cello, ukulele, guitar, and drums. I've also experimented
    a bit with improvisation, composition, and music production,-->
