        <h1>Hi! I'm Kate</h1>
        <p>I love all things exploring and creating,
            especially when it has to do with my handsâ€”
            like building and assembling, or learning new instruments.
            I also enjoy reading (recs always appreciated!), puzzles, and badminton. :)
            </p>

    <!--I've been playing piano since I was 4 years old,
    and have found immense joy and creative expression in music.
    Over the years, I've picked up a few more instruments, including
    the cello, ukulele, guitar, and drums. I've also experimented
    a bit with improvisation, composition, and music production,-->
