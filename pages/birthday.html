        <h2> Happy birthday momo! </h2>
        <p> So much has changed in the past year; can you believe I'm in college now, and we are almost 3000 miles apart? Yet it doesn't feel that way at all -
            you are still just a text or call away. </p>
        <p> I feel a wide range of emotions here: sometimes I feel so full of joy and gratitude I could burst,<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
            and other times (though much rarer) I feel the magnitude of the "firehose" of MIT and college.
        </p>
        <p> Regardless, whatever it is, you're always the first person I want to talk to. I think I take this for granted- I'm so so so lucky to have a momo like you,
            who is there no matter what, who loves and is loved unconditionally,
            who inspires me endlessly with her kindness and humility and joy. And I don't tell you enough!
        </p>
        <p> So thank you momo, for all the times you make me laugh, even when I try my hardest not to...<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p>

        <p> for being there every time I cry, even when I don't know why it is that I am crying...</p>
